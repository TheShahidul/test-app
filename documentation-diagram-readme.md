# HGH-school Engineering Documentation & Diagrams

## SDLC Methodology
For this project, the following SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) methods were followed:

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Stakeholder interviews (school admin, teachers, students)
- Feature list: homepage, news, notices, student/teacher corners, contact info, Google Maps
- Language support: Bangla and English

### 2. Planning
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks
- Milestones: UI wireframes, component setup, routing, feature completion, testing, deployment
- Resource allocation: 1 frontend developer, 1 designer
- Risk assessment: Browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, data accuracy

### 3. Design
- Wireframes for homepage, navbar, footer, body sections
- Component hierarchy diagram
- Color palette: #005181 (primary), #ffc107 (accent), white backgrounds
- Responsive grid layouts

### 4. Development (Agile/Iterative)
- Sprint planning: Weekly goals (e.g., navbar, news ticker, student corner)
- Daily standups/check-ins
- Git branching: feature branches, pull requests
- Code reviews and refactoring

### 5. Testing
- Manual UI testing (desktop, mobile)
- Linting (ESLint)
- Type checking (TypeScript)
- User acceptance testing (UAT) with school staff

### 6. Deployment
- Build with Vite
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (static hosting)
- Monitor for issues

### 7. Maintenance
- Bug fixes
- Feature updates (e.g., add backend API, authentication)
- Documentation updates

## Engineering/Development Perspective
- **Component-based architecture**: Each UI section is a React component for modularity and reusability.
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Ensures rapid styling and responsive design.
- **Routing**: Managed by React Router for SPA navigation.
- **Version Control**: Git used for source management and collaboration.
- **Testing**: Manual and lint-based testing for reliability.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and diagram files for future reference.
- **Deployment**: Vite build, static hosting, CI/CD ready

## How to Use
- Use the flowchart, class diagram, and data flow diagram with tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or AI diagram generators to create visual diagrams.
- Update SDLC and engineering notes as the project evolves.
- For formal documentation, export diagrams as PNG/SVG and include in project docs.
